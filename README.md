This contains code to simulate a system of particles in a box that obey elastic collisions only, so 
all the energy in the system is constant. I used the libsfml-dev to create this simulation. 

To run this program:

1. Clone this repository or folder (use git sparse)
2. Make sure to have SMFL downloaded, run "sudo apt-get install libsmfl-dev"
3. Navigate to the ParticleSimulation directory
4. Run make
5. Launch the program using ./ParticleSimulation
